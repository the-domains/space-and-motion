  A preposition describes a relationship between other words in a sentence. In
  itself, a word like "in" or "after" is rather meaningless and hard to define
  in mere words. For instance, when you do try to define a preposition like "in"
  or "between" or "on," you invariably use your hands to show how something is
  situated in relationship to something else.
